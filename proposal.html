            Problem Description
        </h2>

        <h3>
            Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest.
        </h3>
        <p>
            The topic of interest is to support local businesses and aid people with dietary restrictions. For people
            with dietary restrictions like allergies or veganism, restaurants can be tough to find with proper care for
            these restrictions and local restaurants are excellent for helping those with restrictions. However, local
            restaurants are usually not popular and so we want to help local restaurants connect with people that need
            special catering
        </p>


        <h3>
            Identify an information technology problem in that space.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Local restaurants are challenged by two primary problems–lack of brand awareness and lack of funds.
            Local restaurants do not have the time or resources to maintain an online presence. This is detrimental
            because in today’s digital age, many potential customers are online. A <a
                href="https://www.brightlocal.com/research/local-consumer-review-survey/">2022 BrightLocal
                survey</a> found that 78% of consumers use the internet to find information about local businesses
            more than once a week. Without an online presence, local restaurants won’t be able to reach this market
            of online consumers. With a small customer base, local restaurants would, in turn, struggle to maintain
            a strong cash flow. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for eating out has further decreased with
            the rise of new variants and safety protocols. A <a
                href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006991117#fn1">2020 survey of 5,800 small
                businesses</a> indicates that about 75% of respondents only make enough cash to last 2 months at a
            time.

            Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem.
        </h3>
        <p>
            One existing attempt to solve this problem is Yelp. Yelp is a very popular platform used to find
            restaurants based on distance, price, and cuisines. Besides allowing users to find restaurants through
            the filtering feature, Yelp also lets its users save the restaurants in a collection for later
            reference. One important feature that Yelp implements is the rating/review feature. Users can give
            ratings and reviews about a restaurant at which it will be visible on the restaurant page and affect the
            reputation of the restaurant. User’s friends and the public can also see these reviews or the
            restaurants the user liked from the user’s profile page.

        <h2>
            App Description
        </h2>

        <h3>
            Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our app is meant to be used by anyone who wants to share or view local restaurants. Local restaurant
            owners would also be able to view the website to see how the restaurant is perceived in the community.
        </p>


        <h3>
            What kind of information will the users be viewing? If you're drawing data form an external source (a
            csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
        </h3>
        <p>
            The information on the website will be mostly user-generated. Users will be able to add to the data
            available on the website as well as view other users’ suggestions. An additional data source that we
            plan on using (if we need to) is a dataset of all Seattle restaurants from Kaggle linked <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oklena/seattle-area-restaurants">here</a>.
        </p>


        <h3>
            What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interaction are you expecting to provide?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Users can interact with the app using three features:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Search for local restaurants and filter by different allergies, cuisines, distance, price, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Favorite local restaurants to curate a personal collection of favorite restaurants in the user's profile.
            </li>
            <li>
                Upload new local restaurants by inputting information such as name, images, tags (e.g., allergen-free), price range, location, menu, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <h3>
            How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem
            you described?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our app’s main goal is to encourage people to engage with the local small restaurant community. Along
            the way, we hope to resolve problems for users who hope to filter restaurants based on allergies,
            cuisines, and price points. We will also create space with additional resources to support local small
            businesses. While larger apps like Yelp provide people with a platform to view nearby businesses, it
            does not let users search within only small businesses and share their favorite local spots. We believe
            that our website will bring awareness to the local restaurant community and create space for users to
            share their experiences.
