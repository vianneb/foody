            <h3>Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest.</h3>
            <p>
            The topic of interest is to support local businesses and aid people with dietary restrictions. For people with dietary restrictions like allergies or veganism, restaurants can be tough to find with proper care for these restrictions and local restaurants are excellent for helping those with restrictions. However, local restaurants are usually not popular and so we want to help local restaurants connect with people that need special catering. </p>

            <h3> Identify an information technology problem in that space.
            </h3>

            <p>Local restaurants are challenged by two primary problems–lack of brand awareness and lack of funds. Local restaurants do not have the time or resources to maintain an online presence. This is detrimental because in today’s digital age, many potential customers are online. A 2022 BrightLocal survey found that 78% of consumers use the internet to find information about local businesses more than once a week. Without an online presence, local restaurants won’t be able to reach this market of online consumers. With a small customer base, local restaurants would, in turn, struggle to maintain a strong cash flow. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for eating out has further decreased with the rise of new variants and safety protocols. A 2020 survey of 5,800 small businesses indicates that about 75% of respondents only make enough cash to last 2 months at a time.</p>

            <h3> Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem.</h3>

            <p>One existing attempt to solve this problem is Yelp. Yelp is a very popular platform used to find restaurants based on distance, price, and cuisines. Besides allowing users to find restaurants through the filtering feature, Yelp also lets its users save the restaurants in a collection for later reference. One important feature that Yelp implements is the rating/review feature. Users can give ratings and reviews about a restaurant at which it will be visible on the restaurant page and affect the reputation of the restaurant. User’s friends and the public can also see these reviews or the restaurants the user liked from the user’s profile page.</p>

            <h3>Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our app is meant to be used by anyone who wants to share or view local restaurants. Local restaurant owners would also be able to view the website to see how the restaurant is perceived in the community.

            <h3>What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interaction are you expecting to provide?</h3>
            <p>
                Users can interact with the app in three different ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Generate content by adding new data about local restaurants in the app. Users will be able to add one spot or create a collection of businesses for others to view.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Users can browse content others have posted and interact with it by viewing it, sharing it, or adding it to their list collection.
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        Users can use our website to access resources to support small business communities by viewing opportunities to donate, volunteer, and raise awareness.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
            </h3>

            <p>
                Our app’s main goal is to encourage people to engage with the local small restaurant community. Along the way, we hope to resolve problems for users who hope to filter restaurants based on allergies, cuisines, and price points. We will also create space with additional resources to support local small businesses. While larger apps like Yelp provide people with a platform to view nearby businesses, it does not let users search within only small businesses and share their favorite local spots. We believe that our website will bring awareness to the local restaurant community and create space for users to share their experiences.
